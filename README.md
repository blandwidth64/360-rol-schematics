# 360-rol-schematics
a collection of some ring of light revisions, scanned and digitized in kicad by me

i started the project in feb 2024, with the goal of getting a better idea of how these things tick. it was also my excuse to finally learn kicad.

along the way i did my best to annotate all the traces i could competently identify, and for some of the main ic traces i just guessed.

thanks to drtrinity.
