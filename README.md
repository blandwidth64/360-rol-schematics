# 360-rol-schematics
a collection of some ring of light revisions, scanned and digitized in kicad by me

i started the project in feb 2024, with the goal of getting a better idea of how these things tick. it was also my excuse to finally learn kicad.
update 3/14/2025 (happy pi day), i bought a digital caliper, so now i guess im also documenting the actual connectors? fusion360 is easier than i was expecting. PLEASE PROOFREAD MY WORK BEFORE USING ANY AS GOSPEL PLEASE PLEASE PRETTY PLEASE

along the way i did my best to annotate all the traces i could competently identify, and for some of the main ic traces i just guessed.

i will upload the work in order of whenever i am finished or whenever i think its good enough to go out.

thanks to drtrinity.
